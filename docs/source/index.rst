ReFANN
======

**ReFANN (Reconstruct Functions with Artificial Neural Network)**

ReFANN is a nonlinear interpolating tool based on ANN, without assuming a model or parameterization. It can reconstruct functions from data with no assumption to the data, and is a completely data-driven approach.

It is proposed by `Guo-Jian Wang, Xiao-Jiao Ma, Si-Yao Li, Jun-Qing Xia (2020) <https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/ab620b>`_.

How to use ReFANN
=================

First, you are probably going to needs see the :ref:`introduction` guide to learn the basic principles of ReFANN. After that, you may need to install refann on your computer according to the :ref:`installation` guide, and then following the :ref:`quickStart` guide to learn how to use it. If you need more detailed information about a specific function, the :ref:`package_reference` below should have what you need.
