ReFANN
=====

**ReFANN (Reconstruct Functions with Artificial Neural Network)**

ReFANN is a nonlinear interpolating tool based on ANN, without assuming 
a model or parameterization. 

It can reconstruct functions from data with no assumption to the data, 
and is a completely data-driven approach.

It is proposed by Guo-Jian Wang, Xiao-Jiao Ma, Si-Yao Li, and Jun-Qing Xia (2020),
